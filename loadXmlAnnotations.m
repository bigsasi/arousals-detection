%LOADSHHSANNOTATIONS load annotations from a xml file. xml structure should follow 
% shhs xml files. This is, events should be annotated following the structure
% CMPStudyConfig.ScoredEvents.ScoredEvent
%   filename    complete file name (with path) 
%   annotations struct with a field for each event type. Field names are the 
%               ones used in the xml files, without white spaces.
