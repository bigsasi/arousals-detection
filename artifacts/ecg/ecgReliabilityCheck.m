% Attempting classification

% We assume we perform an analysis on a analysisBPM second basis, then we assume we
% can trust the analysisBPM higher peaks. We are thus assuming an equivalent to analysisBPM bpm.
% This is not risky, if we have higher rate, then still the analysisBPM first peaks
% should be ok (should have little variability). If we have less than
% analysisBPM
% peaks in a minute basis (bpm < analysisBPM), then we still can reason with the peaks we have.
% The reason to reason on a "subset" of the total number of peaks is that
% sometimes P waves are included (it depends on the accuracy of the
% threshold), which generates two clusters of peaks (R waves, P waves) and
% this can hamper analysis of variability (P waves are introducing
% artificial variability in the R waves)
