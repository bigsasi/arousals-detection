%ECGCONDITIONING Removes EKG artifacts from signal
%   [SIGNAL] = ecgConditioning(SIGNAL, SRATE, EKGRATE, RELEKG, RPEAKS)
%   returns the signal without EKG artifacts. SRATE represents the signal
%   rate and EKGRATE the EKG rate. RELEKG is a vector sampled at EKGRATE
%   that indicates if the RPEAKS are reliable or not. RPEAKS is the list of
%   R-peaks inducing the artifacts.
