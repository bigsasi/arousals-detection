%GETSIGNALEVENTS Return events for a signal parameter given a baseline and
%certain threshold
%   [events] = getSignalEvents(signalParameter, threshold, unionTime, 
%   windowStep, baseline) returns an array with market events for a signal 
%   parameter when this paraemter is higher than a baseline multiplied by 
%   a threshold.
