%REMOVEAWAKEEVENTS Remove arousals during W stage using an hypnogram
%   EVENTS = REMOVEAWAKEEVENTS(EVENTS, HYPNOGRAM) returns the events
%   happening during an epoch not scored as W
% 
%   [EVENTS, DISCARDED] = REMOVEAWAKEEVENTS(EVENTS, HYPNOGRAM) also returns
%   the list of events happening during W epochs.
